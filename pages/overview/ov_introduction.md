summary: This tutorial introduces a browser-based interactive visualization system, called CellTrackVis, for supporting the quick and easy analysis of cell movements with relevant information.
---

## Motivation
Existing tools for studying cell trajectories and lineages have room for improvements, although those have been well developed.

## Objective
To address requirements for the analysis of cell behavior patterns. Prominent features of this tool include:

- Visual interactivity
- Standalone tool
- Integrated interfaces
- Flexible input
