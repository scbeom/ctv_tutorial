summary: This tutorial introduces a browser-based interactive visualization system, called CellTrackVis, for supporting the quick and easy analysis of cell movements with relevant information.
---

## Motivation
Existing tools for studying cell trajectories and lineages have some limitations although those have been well developed.

## Objective
To address requirements for the analysis of cell behavior patterns. Prominent features of this tool include:

* Interactive visualization of cell tracking results
* Interconnected analysis modules
* Multi-directional views

## System overview
